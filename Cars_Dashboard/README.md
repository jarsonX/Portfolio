# Introduction

This is a simple dashboard application for automobile dataset.

The main purpose of this project was to practice visualization skills in Dash. It was written as a part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course.

My task was to visually show the 'body-style' and 'prices' attributes with respect to each 'drive-wheels' selected. This had to be completed in the form of 2 interactive charts, i.e. a pie chart and a bar chart.
