## About this Project
The project is based on a Capstone Project originally included as a part of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. However, I was a bit dissapointed with it, meaning that in real life I would perform much more cleaning on the dataset than it was actually required to pass the exam. That is why I created my own version, which hopefully, more accurately represents actual data analyst's work.

## Goal
Clean, analyze and visualize the data from Stack Overflow's survey of software professionals.

## Modules
1. Data preapartion
2. Data exploration
3. Data visualization
4. Creating a dashboard *- in progress and to be uploaded soon*
