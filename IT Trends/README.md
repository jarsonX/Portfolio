# IT Trends Analysis Project <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roshangrewal/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certification/master/IBM-Banner.png" align="right" width="120" />

## About this Project
The project is based on a Capstone Project originally included as a part of IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. However, I was a bit dissapointed with it, meaning that in real life I would perform much more cleaning on the dataset than it was actually required to pass the exam. That is why I created my own version, which hopefully, more accurately represents actual data analyst's work.

## Disclaimer for People Taking IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course
You are more than welcome to check my project, compare it to your work and even borrow chunks of code. However, please be advised that due to reasons described above, there are SIGNIFICANT differences between my results and the results required to pass the exam.
