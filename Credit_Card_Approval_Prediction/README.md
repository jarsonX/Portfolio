# Machine Learning and Data Science post-graduate course, 2022
**University of Economics in Katowice**

## About this Project
This is my final project for Machine Learning Fundamentals class. My task was to choose a dataset, define a problem, and create a solution that utilise one or more machine learning algorithms. I decided to use **Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository**. It should be noted that all attribute names and values in the aforementioned dataset have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality. Therefore I had to assume that all attributes all important and should be treated as predictors.

## Skills demonstrated
- Python programming (including Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Fundamental knowledge in respect of machine learning algorithms
- Clean coding

## Tools utilised
- MS Excel and PowerQuery (for initial data exploration)
- Google Colab
