# Machine Learning and Data Science post-graduate course, 2022
**University of Economics in Katowice**

## About this Project
This is my final project for Machine Learning Fundamentals class. My task was to choose a dataset, define a problem, and create a solution that utilise one or more machine learning algorithms. I decided to use Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It should be notet that all attribute names and values in the aforementioned dataset have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect confidentiality of the data. Therefore I had to assume that all attributes all important and should be treated as predictors.
